# Profile System Fixes and Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to resolve the potential issues identified in the Prok Professional Networking profile system.

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing GET Profile Endpoint** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Backend only had PUT endpoint, no GET endpoint to retrieve profile data.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive GET `/api/profile` endpoint in `app/backend/api/profile.py`:
- Retrieves user profile data with JWT authentication
- Creates default profile if none exists
- Returns both profile and user data
- Includes proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `app/backend/api/profile.py` - Added GET endpoint and improved error handling

### 2. **Static File Serving for Uploaded Images** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Uploaded profile images couldn't be served to the frontend.

**Solution**: Added static file serving route in `app/backend/main.py`:
- Added `/uploads/<filename>` route to serve uploaded files
- Automatic uploads directory creation
- Secure file serving with proper directory handling

**Files Modified**:
- `app/backend/main.py` - Added static file serving and uploads directory setup

### 3. **Frontend API Integration Gap** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Frontend was using localStorage mock data instead of real API calls.

**Solution**: Updated both ProfileView and ProfileEdit components:
- **ProfileView.tsx**: Added API integration with loading states and error handling
- **ProfileEdit.tsx**: Connected to real backend endpoints for fetch and save operations
- Added proper data transformation between frontend and API formats
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and loading states

**Files Modified**:
- `app/frontend/src/components/profile/ProfileView.tsx` - Full API integration
- `app/frontend/src/components/profile/ProfileEdit.tsx` - Full API integration

### 4. **Error Handling Improvements** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Limited error handling throughout the application.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling:
- **Backend**: Added try-catch blocks, proper error responses, and logging
- **Frontend**: Added React ErrorBoundary component
- **API Layer**: Improved error handling in all endpoints
- **File Upload**: Enhanced validation and error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `app/backend/api/profile.py` - Enhanced error handling
- `app/frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - New error boundary component
- `app/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wrapped app with ErrorBoundary

### 5. **Missing Dependencies** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Pillow dependency was missing for image processing.

**Solution**: Added Pillow to requirements.txt for image processing functionality.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/backend/requirements.txt` - Added Pillow==10.0.1

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### **Comprehensive Test Suite** âœ… ADDED

Created `app/backend/test_profile.py` with comprehensive test coverage:
- Profile retrieval tests
- Profile update tests
- Image upload tests
- Error handling tests
- Authentication tests
- Data validation tests

## ðŸ“Š API Endpoints Summary

### **Profile Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/profile` - Retrieve user profile (NEW)
- `PUT /api/profile` - Update user profile (IMPROVED)
